# Random Number Picker
This is a random number picker I developed specifically to give me a truly random number from a list for my 100 day/100 song karaoke challenge (posting soon). feel free to use and fork however you like

# How to use
Simply change the data in the '[numbers.json](./numbers.json)' file and add your own numbers

# Future plans
I don't plan to support this project in the future however I *MAY* add support for something other than numbers

# NO SUPPORT
This project comes with no support from me as it is a personal project
