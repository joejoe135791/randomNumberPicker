# Random Number Picker
This is a random number picker I developed specifically to give me a truly random number from a list for my 100 day/100 song karaoke challenge (posting soon). feel free to use and fork however you like (with attribution)

# How to use
Simply change the data in the '[data.json](./data.json)' file and add your own data. A tool for this will be developed soon

add your entries to '[data.json](./data.json), seperated by a comma, such as in [example.json](./example.json). For automatically opening links, copy paste the data under 'data', make sure that any numbers are in quotes, add a colon after the data but before the comma, and set the value to `null` if you do not want the selection to open a link or put your links in quotes after the colon

change settings in config.json

# Future plans
- [X] Integrate with OBS using text and webhooks
- [X] Allow the automatically opening a URL after choosing a song
- [ ] Create an easier, seperate program that appends data to the .json file for easier editing

I currently don't plan to support this project in the future, outside of the items above, ~~however I *MAY* add support for something other than numbers~~
Update: I did add support for something other than numbers
