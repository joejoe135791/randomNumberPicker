# Random Number Picker
This is a random number picker I developed specifically to give me a truly random number from a list for my 100 day/100 song karaoke challenge (posting soon). feel free to use and fork however you like (with attribution)

# How to use
Simply change the data in the '[data.json](./data.json)' file and add your own numbers

# Future plans
- [ ] Integrate with OBS using text and webhooks
- [ ] Allow the automatically opening a URL after choosing a song
- [ ] Create an easier, seperate program that appends data to the .json file for easier editing

I currently don't plan to support this project in the future, outside of the items above, however I *MAY* add support for something other than numbers
